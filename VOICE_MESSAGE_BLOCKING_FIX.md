# ðŸš« Voice Message Blocking Fix

## âœ… **Issue Identified and Fixed:**

### **Root Cause:**
The RAG system was processing voice messages correctly, but the **original voice message was still reaching the avatar** after the RAG response was sent. This caused the avatar to receive both:
1. The RAG-generated response (which it should speak)
2. The original user voice message (which it was repeating instead)

### **Fix Applied:**
**Added early return** in the voice message interceptor to **block the original voice message** from reaching the avatar when RAG is enabled.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

### **Debug Logs to Look For:**
```
ðŸŽ¤ Voice message intercepted from user: How to sign up?
ðŸŽ¤ RAG State: {isEnabled: true, documentCount: 1}
ðŸŽ¤ sendMessageWithRAG exists: true
ðŸ§  Processing voice message through RAG system - BLOCKING original message
ðŸš« Blocking original voice message from reaching avatar
âœ… Voice message processed through RAG successfully - original message blocked
```

### **Expected Flow:**
1. **User speaks "How to sign up?"** â†’ Voice message intercepted
2. **Original message blocked** â†’ Avatar never receives the user's question
3. **RAG system processes** â†’ Finds relevant documents, generates response
4. **RAG response sent** â†’ Avatar receives only the RAG response
5. **Avatar speaks RAG response** â†’ "To sign up, access the homepage and look for the sign-up option..."

## ðŸ§ª **Test Steps:**

1. **Restart the application** to load the voice message blocking fix
2. **Upload your document** to RAG system
3. **Start streaming** with avatar
4. **Speak a question** like "How to sign up?" (use voice, not typing)
5. **Check console logs** for the debug messages above

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria:**

- âœ… **Debug logs show** voice message interception and blocking
- âœ… **RAG system processes** the voice question
- âœ… **Avatar speaks RAG response** instead of repeating the question
- âœ… **No duplicate messages** - only RAG response reaches avatar

## ðŸ”§ **Key Changes:**

- âœ… **Early return** prevents original voice message from reaching avatar
- âœ… **RAG response only** - avatar receives only the processed response
- âœ… **Clean message flow** - no conflicts between original and RAG messages

## ðŸŽ¯ **If Still Not Working:**

If the avatar still doesn't speak the RAG response, check:
1. **Console logs** - Is the original message being blocked?
2. **RAG response** - Is it being sent to avatar successfully?
3. **Avatar mode** - Is it still in Mode 1 (Repeat)?

Let me know what debug logs you see when you speak to the avatar!
