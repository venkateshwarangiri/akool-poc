# ðŸŽ¯ Concise RAG Responses - IMPLEMENTED

## âœ… **Problem Resolved:**
**RAG responses were too long and detailed, making them overwhelming for voice interactions**

### **Example of Previous Long Response:**
```
"Dr. Maya Elara Singh is a distinguished international climate change expert with a wealth of experience in the field. She has a significant track record in designing, implementing, and evaluating multi-country climate programs. These programs are often funded by prominent organizations such as the World Bank, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Green Climate Fund (GC). Her extensive expertise in climate change is underscored by her involvement in these large-scale, multi-national initiatives, which require a sophisticated understanding of both the scientific and socio-economic aspects of climate change. Dr. Singh's work likely involves collaborating with various stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and international bodies, to develop and execute comprehensive strategies aimed at mitigating climate impacts and enhancing resilience. Her role would entail a deep engagement with policy development, environmental planning, and the assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities across different regions and sectors."
