# ðŸ“‹ Preserve Document Format - COMPLETED

## âœ… **Adjustment Complete:**
**RAG system now preserves original document structure and formatting in responses**

### **Problem Resolved:**
The RAG system was providing good detailed responses but not maintaining the original document's structure and formatting. You wanted responses to preserve the document's original format (like bullet points, headings, etc.) rather than just paraphrasing the content.

## âœ… **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Updated Prompt Instructions:**
```typescript
// Before (paraphrasing without format):
"Provide DETAILED and COMPREHENSIVE answers using the available document information"
"Include specific details, examples, and relevant information from the documents"

// After (preserving original format):
"Provide DETAILED and COMPREHENSIVE answers using the available document information while preserving the original document structure and formatting"
"PRESERVE the original document structure, formatting, and organization when presenting information"
"Use bullet points, numbered lists, headings, and other formatting elements as they appear in the original documents"
```

### **2. Format Preservation Instructions:**
```typescript
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide DETAILED and COMPREHENSIVE answers using the available document information
2. PRESERVE the original document structure, formatting, and organization when presenting information
3. Use bullet points, numbered lists, headings, and other formatting elements as they appear in the original documents
4. Include specific details, examples, and relevant information from the documents

8. For document-related questions, provide detailed and informative responses with specific examples while maintaining original formatting
9. Give comprehensive answers that fully address the user's question with available information in the document's original structure
```

### **3. Specific Format Examples:**
```typescript
