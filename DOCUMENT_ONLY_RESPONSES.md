# 📄 Document-Only Response Configuration

## ✅ **Problem Solved:**
The avatar now responds ONLY from uploaded documents, not from general knowledge.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Enhanced RAG Prompts**
Updated both Enterprise RAG and Chroma RAG services with strict document-only prompts.

**Before (General Knowledge Allowed):**
```
You are an enterprise AI assistant. Based on the following company documents, please provide a comprehensive and accurate answer to the user's question.

Instructions:
1. Answer based primarily on the provided documents
2. If the answer cannot be found in the documents, clearly state this
```

**After (Document-Only):**
```
You are a document-based AI assistant. You MUST ONLY answer questions using information from the provided documents. Do NOT use any external knowledge or general information.

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY use information from the provided documents above
2. If the answer is NOT in the documents, respond with: "I don't have information about this in my knowledge base. Please check the uploaded documents or contact support."
3. Do NOT provide general knowledge or external information
4. Do NOT make assumptions beyond what's explicitly stated in the documents
5. Cite the specific document source when providing information
6. If multiple documents have conflicting information, mention this clearly
7. Keep responses concise and directly from the documents
```

### **2. Strict Response Guidelines**
- ✅ **Document-Only**: Avatar only uses uploaded document content
- ✅ **No External Knowledge**: No general AI knowledge or assumptions
- ✅ **Clear Fallback**: Specific message when information isn't in documents
- ✅ **Source Citation**: References specific documents when answering
- ✅ **Conflict Handling**: Mentions when documents have conflicting information

### **3. Updated Services**
- ✅ **Enterprise RAG Service**: Updated prompt for document-only responses
- ✅ **Chroma RAG Service**: Updated prompt for document-only responses
- ✅ **Fallback Response**: Already document-focused when no results found

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Scenario 1: Question About Document Content**
**User**: "What is mentioned about income streams in the document?"
**Avatar**: "Based on the uploaded document '6 MAYI IQ Income Streams.docx', the document mentions [specific content from document]..."

### **Scenario 2: Question Not in Documents**
**User**: "What is the weather today?"
**Avatar**: "I don't have information about this in my knowledge base. Please check the uploaded documents or contact support."

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Documents with Conflicting Info**
**User**: "What is the company policy on X?"
**Avatar**: "I found conflicting information in the uploaded documents. Document A states [X], while Document B states [Y]. Please review both documents for clarification."

## 📋 **Response Types:**

| Question Type | Avatar Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **In Documents** | ✅ Answers from document content + source citation |
| **Not in Documents** | ❌ "I don't have information about this in my knowledge base..." |
| **Conflicting Info** | ⚠️ Mentions conflict and cites both sources |
| **General Knowledge** | ❌ Refuses to answer, refers to documents |

## 🧪 **Test the Document-Only Responses:**

1. **Upload your DOCX file** (e.g., "6 MAYI IQ Income Streams.docx")
2. **Enable LLM and RAG** (should auto-enable)
3. **Ask questions about document content**:
   - "What does the document say about income streams?"
   - "What are the main topics covered?"
4. **Ask questions NOT in the document**:
   - "What is the capital of France?"
   - "How do I cook pasta?"
5. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Document questions: Answered from document content
   - ❌ General questions: "I don't have information about this in my knowledge base..."

## 🎉 **Result:**
**The avatar now acts as a strict document-based assistant!**
- ✅ Only answers from uploaded documents
- ✅ Refuses to use general knowledge
- ✅ Provides clear fallback messages
- ✅ Cites document sources
- ✅ Handles conflicting information

**Your avatar is now a true document-based knowledge assistant! 🚀**
