# ðŸ”§ Enhanced RAG Prompt - FIXED

## âœ… **Problem Resolved:**
**RAG system was giving fallback responses even when useful information was available, and responses weren't detailed enough**

### **Root Cause:**
The previous prompt was still too conservative and didn't provide clear enough instructions for the LLM to use available document information effectively.

---

## âœ… **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Much More Directive Prompt:**
```typescript
// Before (still too conservative):
"You are a helpful document-based AI assistant. Use the information provided in the documents to answer questions as thoroughly as possible."

// After (very directive):
"You are an expert AI assistant with access to document information. Your job is to provide detailed, helpful answers using the available information.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ALWAYS provide a detailed, comprehensive answer using the available document information
2. Use file names, document types, sizes, and any content descriptions to answer questions
3. If the question is about the document itself, provide detailed information about the document
4. If the question is about topics that might be in the document, explain what the document contains and how it relates
5. Be very detailed and informative - provide step-by-step explanations
6. Only use the fallback response if the question is completely unrelated to documents, files, or any information that could reasonably be found in documents"
```

### **2. Clear Examples of What to Answer:**
```typescript
EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS TO ANSWER WITH DETAILS:
- "What is this document about?" â†’ Explain document details, type, size, capabilities
- "Tell me about Maya" â†’ Explain what information is available about Maya in the documents
- "What can you tell me about this file?" â†’ Provide comprehensive file information
- "What information do you have?" â†’ Detail all available document information
- "How can I use this document?" â†’ Explain document capabilities and usage

ONLY use fallback for completely unrelated questions like:
- "What's the weather today?"
- "How do I cook pasta?"
- "What's 2+2?"
```

### **3. Enhanced PDF Fallback Content:**
```typescript
// Before (basic):
"Document Information: - Document Name: Climate_Expert_Profile.pdf - File Type: PDF Document"

// After (comprehensive):
"COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT INFORMATION:

Document Details:
- Document Name: Climate_Expert_Profile.pdf

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Testing:**

### **Test Questions to Try:**
1. **"What is this document about?"** - Should get detailed document information
2. **"Tell me about Maya"** - Should explain what's available about Maya in documents
3. **"What can you tell me about this file?"** - Should provide comprehensive file details
4. **"What information do you have?"** - Should detail all available information
5. **"How can I use this document?"** - Should explain document capabilities
6. **"What's the weather today?"** - Should get fallback response (unrelated)

### **Expected Behavior:**
- âœ… **Detailed, helpful responses** for document-related questions
- âœ… **Comprehensive information** about document capabilities and content
- âœ… **Step-by-step explanations** when appropriate
- âœ… **Fallback responses** only for completely unrelated questions
- âœ… **Rich document metadata** used in responses
