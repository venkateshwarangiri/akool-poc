# üìù Natural Text Format - COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ **Adjustment Complete:**
**RAG system now provides detailed information in natural, flowing text format instead of structured formatting**

### **Problem Resolved:**
The RAG system was providing structured information with bullet points, headings, and lists. You wanted detailed information but in normal, flowing text format instead of structured formatting.

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Updated Prompt Instructions:**
```typescript
// Before (structured formatting):
"PRESERVE the original document structure, formatting, and organization when presenting information"
"Use bullet points, numbered lists, headings, and other formatting elements as they appear in the original documents"
"If the document uses specific formatting (like 'Core Skills & Competencies' with bullet points), preserve that exact structure"

// After (natural text format):
"Write in natural, flowing text format - avoid bullet points, numbered lists, headings, or structured formatting"
"Present information in paragraph form with smooth transitions between ideas"
"Use conversational, natural language that flows well"
```

### **2. Natural Text Format Instructions:**
```typescript
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide DETAILED and COMPREHENSIVE answers using the available document information

```
